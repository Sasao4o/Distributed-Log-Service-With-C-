1 - differnece between add_library (to put some src files in it  and linking it to an exec) and 
    defining  list and appending the src files to it "what does it do more in this situation"?

  - It gives a whole lot of options to give over just using a list like the compile options and 
    ability to link multiple libraries together. "And other stuff like enabling certain configs in the projects"
2 - What are the cmake generator expressions?
