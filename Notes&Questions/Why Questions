We Used Buffer in DISK Manager Before Writing to Doing the IO?
Ans:    Doing many small writes can hurt performance. Each write is ultimately a syscall and if doing frequently can put burden on the CPU. Devices like disks work better dealing with block-aligned data. To avoid the overhead of many small write operations Golang is shipped with bufio.Writer. Data, instead of going straight to destination (implementing io.Writer interface) are first accumulated inside the buffer and send out when buffer is full
Why we use mmap in index file?
