- What can we do to ensure that bustub doesn't fail on ungraceful shut down ?
- More Explanation : Bufferpool view is on pages and this is a bulk description for the modification to be put in a log file 
  and if we wanted to put sql commands with index on the log 
  "The index would be benefial for identifying the last flushed command to the original file", we wouldn't be able to sync that index 
  with the pages that the bufferpool flushed.
  ::To solve this problem we need to read more about transactional logging "May include major changes to the transactions schema of the project and implementing the WAL and Transaction commit protocol"
